   Address). Enabled with Mode=NameTrack. (S. Garner)

1.00-beta (released 2001-03-18)
*) Updated to use new HL Standard Log Format (http://www.hlstats.org/logs/).
   Rewrote much of hlstats.pl to take advantage of features of the new log
   format. (S. Garner)
*) New directive: MinPlayers. Player events will not be recorded if the number
   of players on the server is less than MinPlayers (default 2). (S. Garner)
*) Increased maxlength of weapon code in Weapons table to 32 chars. (S. Garner)
*) Added images for TFC weapons. (Neo, S. Garner)
*) New admin tool: Edit Player Or Clan Details. Allows for editing of a player
   or clan's profile information. (S. Garner)
*) Can now jump to a player's details page by passing a uniqueid (which can be a
   WON ID or an IP Address, depending on MODE) and game code in the URL instead
   of playerid, e.g.: hlstats.php?mode=playerinfo&uniqueid=123456&game=tfc
   Useful for server status utilities wanting to link directly to a player's
   details page. (S. Garner)
*) Clan tag patterns can now be customised; new admin section and new ClanTags
   database table. (S. Garner)
*) Multipage navigation in Table class (hlstats.php) now only shows maximum of
   20 pages, plus "First page" and "Last page" links. (S. Garner)
*) New script: hlstats-resolve.pl. Goes through Events_Connects resolving any
   unresolved IP addresses, and re-grouping hostnames.
*) Moved some common functions to HLstats.plib.
*) New admin tool: Host Statistics. Shows the most popular ISPs (hostnames) for
   players on your servers. (S. Garner)
*) Hostnames are grouped by the first 2 or 3 parts of the address (i.e.
   'max1.xyz.someisp.net' becomes 'someisp.net', and 'max1.xyz.someisp.net.nz'
   becomes 'someisp.net.nz'), but can also be grouped into user-defined group
   names defined with Admin: Host Groups (hlstats_HostGroups). (S. Garner)
*) Hostnames can now be optionally logged when players connect. A DNS reverse-
   lookup is performed on the player's IP. This can be enabled or disabled with
   the DNSResolveIP configuration directive or --dns-resolveip. The DNS timeout
   delay can also be set with DNSTimeout or --dns-timeout. (S. Garner)
*) New admin tool: Reset Statistics. Deletes all players, clans and events from
   relevant tables using TRUNCATE TABLE. (S. Garner)
*) New admin tool: Optimize Database. Runs OPTIMIZE TABLE and ANALYZE TABLE
   MySQL queries for all tables. Can increase database performance with large
   tables, if run regularly. (S. Garner)
*) New admin tool: Admin-Event History (interface for new Events_Admin and
   Events_Rcon tables). (S. Garner)
*) New "Tools" section in Admin interface. (S. Garner)
*) Log speed cheats and Admin Mod messages to hlstats_Events_Admin. (S. Garner)
*) Log Rcon commands to hlstats_Events_Rcon. (S. Garner)
*) Default behaviour is now to use MySQL server time (NOW()), instead of
   hlstats.pl time (time()) and game server time (timestamp on the log data).
   Only the MySQL server needs an accurate clock now. Added a UseTimestamp
   directive to alternatively still use the timestamp from log data. (S. Garner)
*) hlstats.pl can now accept log data on standard input. (S. Garner)
*) hlstats.pl and hlstats-awards.pl now use a common configuration file and
   accept various arguments on the command line. (S. Garner)
*) Add map image to map detail stats. New Option: map_dlurl. (S. Garner)
*) Add map detail stats (mapinfo.inc). (R. Yacketta, S. Garner)
*) Add weapon detail stats (weaponinfo.inc). (R. Yacketta, S. Garner)
*) Fix incorrect urlencode()ing of homepage URLs in playerinfo.inc and in
   claninfo.inc. (S. Garner)
*) Fix table->draw() incorrectly assuming imgdir is in DOCUMENT_ROOT. Now
   determines absolute path to imgdir from SCRIPT_NAME. (S. Garner)
*) Add DB_PCONNECT configuration define to hlstats.php, for optional persistent
   database connections. (S. Garner)
*) Add EXPERIMENTAL $g_mode = "LAN" for tracking players by IP address. The
   structure of some database tables had to be changed to accommodate this; an
   SQL file is provided for upgrading existing databases. (S. Garner)
*) Add $g_deletedays and DELETEDAYS configuration settings. (S. Garner)
*) Reorder regular expression matches in main loop in hlstats.pl; possible
   performance improvement. (S. Garner)
